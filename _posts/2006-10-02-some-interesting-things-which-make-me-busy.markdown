<p>Today I opened my <a href="http://netvibes.com/">netvibes homepage</a> and found that it is nicely improved. Looks are damn fine. All functionalities are quite working. awesome! Also Some extra functionalities are added which makes it a complete web app. There are some nice features and which are so well created that I am not finding words to describe it. It made my day!</p> <p>Also I found a site which lists some free cool programs which are less than 2MB. I was using some of them for very long time. I also want to introduce them to you all.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.utorrent.com/">ÂµTorrent</a> The coolest torrent client which I use regularly size is just 170KB.</li> <li><a href="http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/nsl.htm">NetStat Live</a> TCP/IP protocol monitor which can be used to see your exact throughput on both incoming and outgoing data. I find this program very useful.</li> <li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 and Unix. I haven't used other SSH client after I found PuTTY. Great piece of software.</li> <li><a href="http://us01.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit Reader</a> When I first saw it, it made my day. It is free reader for PDF (Portable Document Format) documents. I always keep it in my USB flash drive.</li></ul> <p>I am a great fan of Nintendo games, when I was 14 years old, I used to play various TV games using my 8 bit Nitendo  Game box. I had a nice collection of various 8 bit games cartridges(I call cassettes) some of them are Mario, Contra, Road Fighter. Today I found a website which has all such games available to play online as a applet with the same music. The link to the site is <a href="http://vnes.thatsanderskid.com/">http://vnes.thatsanderskid.com/</a> . I played some of the games on it. It loads/emulates Nintendo games on the browser with Java. So Java must be installed.</p> <p>I always post my posts on my blog with some third party tools such as Blogjet, Semagic. But for some reasons I was not able to post my posts on blog using these tools. I was in search of a nice program/software which will do this task in a very efficient manner and I found <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a>. This is a very nice software by Microsoft. It is still in beta and I recommend it to <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">download</a> because it's more than worth downloading.</p> <p>I also updated my <a href="http://anilw.info/cv.html">resume/cv</a>. I added its link to my blog. Also revamped <a href="http://anilw.info/">my homepage</a>, added links to various websites and online services which I use. I also started enjoying writing for my blogger blog!!! ;)</p>
