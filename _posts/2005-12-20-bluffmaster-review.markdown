<div style="text-align: justify;">I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476527/">Bluffmaster</a> movie this Sunday. Movie is worth watching. The story is totally new. Songs are listenable. The Right here Right now rocks but the video of the song is different in movie. It appears at last when movie ends. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1299011/">Abhishek</a> has done a good job, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1299011/">Ritesh</a> goes one step ahead of him. Ritesh has performed natural comedy. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1224082/">Boman Irani</a> rocks again. His natural performance can't stop us laughing. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1231899/">Priayanka Chopra</a> looks nice. Finally <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007113/">Nana</a> gets all credit for small but good impact performance. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1391682/">Rohan Sippy</a> has shown he is capable of producing good movies. The movie is worth for the weekend watching.</div>
