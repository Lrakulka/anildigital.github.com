<div style="text-align: justify;">I want to thank <a href="http://digg.com/">digg.com</a> to post about <a href="http://goototal.blogspot.com/">Google Total</a> in front page!<br /><br />Google Total is just a concept! I mean the code required for developing it is not so important or so difficult. I had the idea of Google Total in my mind from long time. I wanted to develop it for my use. One day I thought it will be great, if I can manage to host the GT code through blogger(blogspot). I searched on net found the info that blogger navbar can be removed. So I immediately developed the code and hosted on my new blog named it <a href="http://goototal.blogspot.com/">http://goototal.blogspot.com</a>.<br /><br />From last two months, I was using this service for myself. But yesterday, I came to know that traffic to GT is increased enormously. I checked the referers and got known that someone posted a story about Google Total on digg.com, and it was being massively digged. I was little but happy, but I just got fear in my mind that Google is going to sue me because I used Google services and Google logo without their permission. But this time, I didn't forget to mention clearly "Not affiliated with Google" & "The Google logo and Brand Features are trademarks of Google Inc.", on GT page.<br /><br />I think this service is actually useful to Google and it is a idea that Google should implement themselves. There are already many services which offers similar kind of service that GT offers, like <a href="http://xtra-google.com/">http://xtra-google.com/</a>. The results from such services finally go to Google page. So if such service goes more popular, more searches on Google and beneficial for Google. It is used in the way we use API for different services.<br /><br />One thing I want to make clear that the idea behind Google Total is totally mine.<br /><br />If you want to digg more, <a href="http://www.digg.com/software/Google_Total_-_Much_better_than_the_real_Google">digg Google Total</a><br />Want to bookmark GT on del.icio.us, <a href="http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://goototal.blogspot.com/&amp;title=Google%20Total%20-%20Much%20better%20than%20the%20real%20Google">+del.icio.us</a></div>
