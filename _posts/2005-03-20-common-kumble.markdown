Today India defeated Pakistan in test match at Kolkata. What I liked is the nice bowling by Anil Kumble. He took 7 wickets. This match was important for Saurav Ganguly. It was his homeground. At the Eden Gardens, India hadn't seen the win against Pak. But today India made it. The match was in the interesting stage both teams had good chance of winning. The Kumble destroyed the plans of Pak team. Now India is ahead with 1-0 in the series.
