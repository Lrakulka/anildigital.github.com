<p>It's been more than one week now, since Airtel has blocked my sim card. I had submitted all required documents at the time of purchasing the sim on 9 June. But after some days outgoing call facility was blocked, I activated it by calling a number in Airtel provided by my dealer. But after few days, it got blocked again. Then I activated it again by calling the same number. It got activated. But what the hell again, it got blocked after 2 days. Then I called Airtel prepaid customer care, they said that your documents are not reached. So I provided required documents again. But from that time, until now my prepaid card is not activated. I have balance of Rs. 257 in it. I purchased the sim on 9th June, and today is 9th July. I am with a fear that the Airtel will block my sim permanently. If it does it, then I have to lose my balance of Rs. 257 also number.</p>I think this is happening because of bad service by Airtel as my dealer says that my documents have been forwarded by him. There may be two problems first is that my documents have not reached to Airtel office and the another can be Airtel has not passed its verification. The second one has less chances to occur as I know, I provided correct docs. So chances are the first that my docs are not reached to Airtel. Though my sim is blocked, its GPRS is still working. So I am happy with it. Now I am just waiting for my sim card to get activate.<p>Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/airtel" rel="tag">airtel</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/mobile" rel="tag">mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/blog" rel="tag">blog</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/blogs" rel="tag">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/prepaid" rel="tag">prepaid</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/cell" rel="tag">cell</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/service" rel="tag">service</a></p>
