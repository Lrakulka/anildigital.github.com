<p>This is the first time I have ever given an interview to someone. Yes, interview, an argentinean journalist Ivan Adaime working for the local newspaper <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/">La Nacion</a> mailed me. He asked me to give answers to some questions related to Google Total. Following are some of that questions<br /><em> Why and when did you start with GoogleTotal?<br /></em> How many visits you get in one day?<br /><em> Did someone from Google has contacted you?<br /></em> Do you really love Google? In what items do you think this company is different from others?<br /><br />For those who do not know Google Total here is the <a href="http://goototal.blogspot.com/">link</a> for it. Google Total has been quoted by many sites as "<span style="color: rgb(255, 127, 0);"><em>Better than the real Google</em></span>"</p>
