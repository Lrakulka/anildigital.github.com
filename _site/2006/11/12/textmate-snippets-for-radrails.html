<p>I was always fascinated about TextMate. I have read huge material on TextMate editor. You must have seen TextMate if you have seen <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/screenshots">these screencasts</a> of Rails.<br />Now you can get the goodness of TextMate on Windows, <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/">Dr. Nic</a> has <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2006/11/06/post-halloween-radrails-trick-all-textmate-snippets-available/">ported TextMate snippet libraries over RadRails</a>. It's not very same as TextMate but it's a $3000 cheaper. So do check it out.</p>
