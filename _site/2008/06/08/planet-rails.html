<p>Checkout <a href="http://planetrails.digitalcodes.org">Planet Rails</a>, side project on which I worked for last two weekends. It's a planet site for top Ruby on Rails related weblogs.</p>

<p>Planet site aggregates feeds of different weblogs into one site. It's having RSS feed support, so if you subscribe the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PlanetRails">RSS feed</a> of it, you will never miss posts by your favorite Rails blogs. If you already know existing <a href="http://planetrubyonrails.com">most popular Rails planet site</a> by Pratik, you know what Planet is.</p>

<p>I have added only few feed channels to it those I like. Mainly to have quality content. Feel free to contact to for adding you popular Rails weblog to the planet. I would definitely try to add it.</p>

<p>On the technical side, I am using my Slicehost slice for hosting it. Mongrel + Nginx combo. It's using Rails. It is open source you could check its <a href="https://github.com/anildigital/planet/tree">source here</a>. Apart from those thanks to Capistrano + <a href="http://git.or.cz">Git</a> which makes development so enjoyable without pain. I see my planet as defacto site to read great Rails posts.</p>

<p>If you find Planet site/source useful please donate <a href="http://pledgie.org/campaigns/1047"><img src="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/1047.png?skin_name=chrome" border="0" alt="Click here to lend your support to: planet and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !" /></a>
 
<em>(Blog authors who don't want to have their posts to be displayed in Planet, feel free to contact, I would happily remove feed).</em></p>
